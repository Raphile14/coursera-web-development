                        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup 
                        language for documents designed to be displayed in a 
                        web browser.

                        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server 
                        or from local storage and render the documents into 
                        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of 
                        a web page semantically and originally included cues 
                        for the appearance of the document.

                        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language 
                        used for describing the presentation of a document 
                        written in a markup language like HTML.

                        CSS is designed to enable the separation of 
                        presentation and content, including layout, colors, 
                        and fonts. This separation can improve content 
                        accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in 
                        the specification of presentation characteristics, 
                        enable multiple web pages to share formatting by 
                        specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file.

                        JavaScript (JS), often abbreviated as JS, is a 
                        programming language that conforms to the 
                        ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, 
                        often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It 
                        has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, 
                        prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class 
                        functions.

                        <br> <br>

                        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core 
                        technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables 
                        interactive web pages and is an essential part of web 
                        applications.
